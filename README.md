# Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Pipeline 🧹

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository implements a complete data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline on the popular **Titanic** dataset. The focus is on:
- detecting & handling duplicates  
- exploring data types and missing values  
- dropping or imputing columns with heavy missingness  
- identifying and removing outliers  
- encoding categorical variables  
- scaling numeric features  
- preparing the cleaned data for modeling  

The goal is to demonstrate good practices in data cleaning and to provide a reusable template for your own datasets.

## 📖 Dataset Description

* **Dataset**: Titanic — “Kaggle: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” (or whichever source you're using).
* **Features** (a few of them):

  * `PassengerId`, `Survived`
  * `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`

In this project:

* We drop or clean columns such as `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin` due to irrelevance or high missingness.
* We impute missing `Age`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`.
* We detect outliers (especially in `Age`) and remove extreme values.
* We convert categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) into numeric form and scale numeric features (e.g. via StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed, along with these packages:

```text
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

You can install them via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Place your Titanic CSV file (e.g. `train.csv`) into `data/raw/`.

3. Open Jupyter and run the notebook:

   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Cleaning.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow and execute the cells in order: cleaning → imputation → outlier filtering → encoding → scaling.

### Running as Script

You can also run the cleaning as a script:

```bash
python scripts/clean_titanic.py --input data/raw/train.csv --output data/cleaned/cleaned_titanic.csv
```

You may add flags or arguments in your script to control behavior (e.g. method of imputation, outlier rules).

## 📊 What You’ll See / Key Steps

1. **Initial Exploration**: `df.info()`, `df.head()`, checking duplicates
2. **Missing Values**: percentage per column
3. **Dropping / Imputing**: dropping low-signal or high-missingness columns; filling missing values
4. **Outlier Detection & Removal**: e.g. using mean ± 2×std or IQR method
5. **Encoding**: converting `Sex`, `Embarked` into dummy / numeric features
6. **Scaling**: standardizing or normalizing numeric columns
7. **Split Features & Target**: `X` (input features) and `y` (Survived) ready for modeling

All these steps are in the notebook (and script) with explanatory comments.

## 🧪 Results & Next Steps

After cleaning and preprocessing:

* The cleaned dataset has no missing values in key features.
* Outlier removal ensures extreme values won’t skew learning.
* Features are encoded and scaled, ready for input into ML models.

From here, you can:

* Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* Evaluate using cross-validation
* Experiment with feature engineering (e.g. extracting titles from `Name`, combining family size, etc.)
* Compare impact of different cleaning/imputation strategies

## 🛠️ Considerations & Caveats

* Removing outliers too aggressively may discard useful data — always inspect the number of dropped rows.
* Imputation using mean/median is simple and may not always be optimal; model-based imputation can do better.
* The method for detecting outliers (mean ± 2σ vs IQR) depends on your data distribution.
* Keep your pipeline reproducible (e.g. using `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`) so that you apply the same transformations to test/new data.
